Podspecs
========

A collection of forked podspecs.


## Setup

Add this spec repo using the command below. Give it a name that starts with a [letter before **M**](http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/private-cocoapods.html#-create-a-private-spec-repo), in this case `forks`.

```
$ git repo add forks https://github.com/phatblat/Podspecs.git
```

It will land in your ~/.cocoapods/repos dir.


## Testing

Use the `pod search` command for simply testing where and how a spec is published.
